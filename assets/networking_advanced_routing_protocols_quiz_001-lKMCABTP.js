systems"],wrongAnswers:["Routing within an AS","Encrypting network traffic","Managing network devices"]},{type:"mcq",text:"Which routing protocol uses the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL)?",difficulty:"medium",explanation:"EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) uses the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) to calculate the shortest path to a destination.",correctAnswers:["EIGRP"],wrongAnswers:["RIP","OSPF","BGP"]},{type:"mcq",text:"OSPF is a distance-vector routing protocol.",difficulty:"easy",explanation:"OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

15.",correctAnswers:["15"],wrongAnswers:["16","255","Unlimited"]},{type:"mcq",text:"BGP uses hop count as a routing metric.",difficulty:"easy",explanation:"BGP is a path-vector routing protocol that

'passive-interface' command in Cisco routers?",difficulty:"hard",explanation:"The 'passive-interface' command prevents a router from sending routing updates out of a specific interface, but still

interface"]},{type:"mcq",text:"The primary goal of EIGRP is to minimize bandwidth usage.",difficulty:"medium",explanation:"EIGRP aims to provide quick convergence times with minimal network traffic,

System-to-Intermediate System)?",difficulty:"hard",explanation:"IS-IS (Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System) is the de facto standard for Internet Service Provider backbone routers.",correctAnswers:["De facto standard for ISP backbone routers"],wrongAnswers:["Distance-vector protocol","Classful routing protocol","Limited hop count"]},{type:"mcq",text:"What is the purpose
